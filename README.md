## Installation

To install and run your site in development mode, use the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm i

# Run in development mode
npm run dev
```

For production, use the following commands:
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Start the project
npm start
```

Environment Variables
Create a .env.local file in the root of your project and add the following variables for links and sitemap:

```bash
SITE_BASE_URL=http://example.com
GITHUB_HREF=https://github.com/example/
TWITTER_HREF=https://x.com/example
PHONE_HREF=tel:+123123123
EMAIL_HREF=mailto:example@gmail.com
LINKEDIN_HREF=https://www.linkedin.com/in/example/
```

These variables need to be added in the production environment as well for the links to work correctly.
